# The Algebraic Theory of Topological Quantum Information
**An introduction to topological quantum information through a rigorous algebraic lens.** 

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for an undergoing project of mine to make a proper introduction to topological quantum information.

The main file to read is the .pdf: Everything else is auxiliary.

Seeing as the goal of this project is to be as accessible as possible, please feel free to give me any feedback on the document.
