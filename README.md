# Toric-Code-Introduction
**A mathematical introduction to Topological Quantum Computing via the toric code.** 

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for an undergoing project of mine to make a concise introduction to topological quantum computation.
The main file to read is the .pdf: Everything else is auxiliary.

Seeing as the goal of this project is to be as accessible as possible, please feel free to give me any feedback on the document.
