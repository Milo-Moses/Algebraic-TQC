\section{Anyon data}

\subsection{Low-rank MTCs}

.[WORK: list of all low-rank MTCs]

\subsection{Abelian MTCs}

.[WORK: classification of abelian MTCs, give data for a lot of examples]

\subsection{Group-theoretical MTCs}

.[WORK: give theorems to characterize all of the data for group-theoretical MTCs, give generously many examples]

\subsection{Miscellaneous examples}

.[WORK: miscillaneous high-rank non-abelian non-group theoretical categories of interest. Probably Haagerup and E6 subfactors \cite{hong2008exotic}. Maybe $SU(2)$ quantum group MTCs for various roots of unity would be nice too.]
