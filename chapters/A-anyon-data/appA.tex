\section{Anyon data}
\label{anyon-data}

\subsection{Low-rank modular categories}

\Note{list of all low-rank MTCs. The relevant papers are \cite{rowell2009classification, bruillard2016classification}.}

\subsection{Abelian modular categories}

\Note {classification of abelian MTCs, give data for a lot of examples}

\subsection{Group-theoretical modular categories}

\Note{give theorems to characterize all of the data for group-theoretical MTCs, give generously many examples}

\subsection{Miscellaneous examples}

\Note{miscillaneous high-rank non-abelian non-group theoretical categories of interest. Probably Haagerup and E6 subfactors \cite{hong2008exotic}. Maybe $SU(2)$ quantum group MTCs for various roots of unity would be nice too.}

\Note{I need an example of a time-reversal symmetric modular category which is not a Drinfeld center, because I think that's cool (and I want to talk about it in the time reversal symmetry subsection). This paper has a good family of abelian examples: \cite{geiko2024does}. (Lemma 4.1.) }

\Note{ I would also like to add some fermionic modular categories and symmetry enriched modular categories. Where should I put those?}
